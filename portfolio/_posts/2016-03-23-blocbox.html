		  <p>I was tasked to create a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which allows people to collect information and store it in a single place. A person can create simple documents, store images, links to websites, and collaborate with others.</p>

  <h2>My Role</h2>

    <p>I was responsible for the UX and UI Design of this project. I was tasked with completing all of the tasks listed below.</p>

<ul>
<li>User personas</li>
<li>User stories</li>
<li>User flows</li>
<li>Sitemap</li>
<li>Lo-fidelity wireframes</li>
<li>Responsive wireframes</li>
<li>High-fidelity mockups</li>
<li>Logo / branding</li>
<li>Style guide</li>
<li>Interactive prototype</li>
<li>HTML/CSS development</li>
<li>Usability Testing</li>
</ul>

		<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
With websites like Pinterest and Evernote, the concept of bookmarking has reached a new level. With various users and various needs it’s becoming more important to centralize content and let users take control. The problem is that most services focus on one thing, for example pinterest’s focus in on storing information through images while Evernote’s focus is storing information in the form of notes. Wouldn’t it be great if there was a service that could do both and more?
</p>

<div class="the-solution">
	<h2>The Solution</h2>
	<p>To create a centralized content hub, the platform should be able to store all kinds of information, because the web is full of all kinds of content. Links, images, docs everything should be able to be stored effortlessly. Along with regular bookmarking features like sorting, tagging and organizing, the platform should support collaboration and sharing.

<h2>The Process</h2>

<h3>Get to know the user</h3>
<p>The first step in building this platform was to understand the user. In order to do that I crafted a survery. With the survey I wanted to understand:</p>
<li>Ways a user saves and shares</li>
<li>Key features of a bookmarking tool</li>
<li>User interest in collaboration and sharing content</li>
<br>
<p>According to the survey results, over 80% of the people work in a collaborative environment and 60% of them mentioned that they share content on a regular basis. This means a user not just saves for himself, but he saves to share it with others. Most users use the browser’s bookmarking tool to save content, while pinterest trails closeby. I could see the gap here, people want to save and share content easily, both are very important to a user, but the tools they use focuses mostly on saving links. User’s also expressed need for a tool that focuses on organization of content, which I thought was also very important.</p>

<h3>Competition</h3>
<p>Services like Pinterest and Evernote do a great job of saving and storing images and notes very effortlessly. While they both were created to save content, they did go specific on the type of content people could save and share, initially. To expand their user base and also provide more value to their existing users, they are adding features such as capability to add all kinds of content and sharing. Blocbox is aiming to do the same while making collaboration and organization it’s key features.</p>

<h3>User stories and flow </h3>

<p>The results of my user survey confirmed a need to create a collaborative platform and my competitive analysis provided on how to best accomplish that. The platform would require users to create notes, images and documents in one easy step, users will have option to sort their bookmarks in a category of their choice. The platform would cater to groups as well as individual users.

To accomplish this I created a prioritized list of user stories for the development of this platform. These user stories would need to be turned into user flows to understand how a user will go about accomplishing a particular task.

<h3>Brand identity and Logo</h3>

<p>With an understanding of the goals of this platform and the attitudes of the end user it was time to develop a brand identity. Ultimately, the users of this product want to effortlessly save/share content and collaborate so they can be productive, make the best use of their time. </p>

<p>The platform is catered towards individuals and groups who have to deal with a lot of content and want to make effective use of their limited time. The identity of this platform should reflect trustworthiness and effectiveness.

<p>Emphasizing both trustworthiness and approachability was greatly impactful when deciding the typeface for this platform. Varela Round has rounded corners, giving it a soft feel that scales, I selected it for headlines. Lato is similar to Varela Round in shape, creating harmony. It has semi-rounded edges and a strong structure to provide our "serious but friendly" tone.</p>

<p>The color palette would need to comprised of colors that showed this juxtaposition of trustworthiness and approachability. Blue immediately came in mind when I thought about trustworthiness.</p>




<h1>Bringing it together</h1>

<h3> Low fi wireframes</h3>
<p>With my brand identity I created the initial low fidelity wireframes. While my user flows gave me the structure needed to think about exactly how a user would move through the site, it was a test of my ability to organize and prioritize information for the web.

Bold imagery and carefully places text would draw in users but ultimately it is the organization of the information on each page that will create loyal users. Low fidelity wireframes were created using Balsamiq.

<h3>Hi fi wireframe</h3>
<p>Equipped with a better understanding of the design of Blocbox I took to low-fi wireframes to create high fidelity wireframes to solidify the look and feel of the platform. I was able to create a high-fidelity clickable prototype in inVision for testing and design feedback before taking the platform to development.

<p>This clickable prototype can be found here.

<h1>Coding the design to life</h1>

<p>Incorporating the feedback from my design critiques I moved forward with developing Blocbox. With fundamental understanding of HTML/CSS, JS and Bootstrap framework I was able to bring the site to life. In addition to Bloc’s offerings I supplemented with tutorials and exercises from Udemy and freecodecamp. </p>
