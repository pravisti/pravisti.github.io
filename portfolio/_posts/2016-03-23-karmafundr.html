			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>KarmaFundr is a crowdfunding web application that lets you raise donation for a cause of your choice.</p>
<h2>My Role</h2>

<p>I performed user research, branding, and UX/UI design for this project. 
</p>
		<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
 For me the problem was to design a solution that encouraged users to donate. Having never done this before, it was a challenge for me. First and an important aspect of my design process was to get users to pay attention to the content. 
<span class="lead-text"> Second was trust</span> which I thought could be gained by making the user feel comfortable while navigating the web application. 
</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>With this project I went straight into Competitive Analysis, because Karma Fundr's business model isn't unique, services like KickStarter has already paved the way and are great examples to follow. My goal with KarmaFundr was to make the user experience as simple as possible.

The common goal of crowdfunding services is to make fundraising easier, which is why design plays such a pivotal role in the success of these platforms. Crowdfunding services like Kickstarter and Generosity may be a bit different but their design model seems to be heading in the same direction, simplicity while acknowledging that design doesn’t end at the landing page.

I made notes of Kickstarter and IndieGogo’s design, to understand how they arrived at the current design of their web application. What can be improved? or done differently, keeping in mind that change doesn't need to be drastic in design. </p>

<h3>User stories and flow </h3>

<p> I created user stories.The goal was to minimize friction for new and existing users. It would require use of design to save time and minimize clicking, so the fundraiser and donation maker can get any task done with minimum time and effort.

The emphasis was on saving the user’s time. Two main users, a fundraiser and a donator, need to accomplish several different tasks efficiently. In order to achieve this, I created a <a href= "#">prioritized</a> list of user stories of the two users to help me in the development of the platform.</p>

<h3>Brand identity and Logo</h3>

<p>I started thinking about the concept of giving. That led me to the word “karma”,  a hindu word which means “deed” or “act” and more broadly names the universal principle of cause and effect, action and reaction, which Hindus believe governs all consciousness. The word is familiar to most people and people associate it with a feeling of positivity. Naming the platform just Karma wasn’t enough, I needed something that created a balance, something concrete to match the fluidity of the word karma. I played with various words until I decided on “Funder”, to make it catchy I changed it to “Fundr”.  Combining the two words I came up with KarmaFundr.</p>

<p>To communicate trust, reliability and ease I leaned into colors and a set of fonts that achieved that effectively. I chose colors based on their emotional implications and also somewhat complimented each other.

I chose Lato for this project. To keep things simple, clean and readable I stayed in the Lato typeface for all aspects of the project and used them consistently throughout the application pages, only changing their size. </p>

<h3>Low-fidelity Wireframes</h3>

<p>Based on the user flow, brand identity, I created low-fidelity prototypes. I started thinking about distribution of content across all pages of the application, hierarchy of content and prioritizing information. The hardest part was to decide what content was more important so it could be highlighted in a certain way. </p>

<h3>Hi-fidelity Wireframes</h3>

<p>Taking the low-fi prototype, I created sketch wireframes. The wireframes I created in Sketch also underwent a few revisions. When I had a solid set of wireframes I creatde an invision prototype. Click on the link below to check it out.

<h3>Coding the design to life</h3>

<p>Now that I had the design ready, I wanted bring it to development. 

I started with HTML and CSS, used minimal JavaScript for this project. Since I had taken a course on Bootstrap and responsive design, I chose to use Bootstrap for this project.
