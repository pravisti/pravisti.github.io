			<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>KarmaFundr is a crowdfunding web application that lets you raise donation for a cause of your choice.</p>
<h2>My Role</h2>

<p>I performed user research, branding, and UX/UI design for this project. 
</p>
		<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>
The problem was to design a solution that encouraged users to donate. The first most important aspect of my design process was make users feel comfortable. 
<span class="lead-text"> Second was trust</span> which could be gained by making the user feel comfortable as they navigate the site.  
</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>I started with Competitive Analysis. Karma Fundr's business model isn't unique, KickStarter has already paved the way for crowdfunding. My goal with KarmaFundr was to make the user experience simple and straightforward.

I made notes of Kickstarter and IndieGogo’s design, to understand how they arrived at the current design. What can be improved or changed? Keeping in mind these questions I moved on to the next step of the design process. </p>

<h3>User stories and flow </h3>

<p>
 Two main users, a fundraiser and a donator, need to accomplish several different tasks efficiently. In order to achieve this, I created a <a href= "#">prioritized</a> list of user stories of the two users to help me in the development of the platform.</p>

<h3>Brand identity and Logo</h3>

<p>I started thinking about the concept of giving. That led me to the word “karma”, the word is familiar to most people and most associate it with a feeling of positivity. Naming the platform just Karma wasn’t enough, I needed something that created a balance, something concrete to match the fluidity of the word karma. I played with various words until I decided on “Funder”, Combining the two words I came up with KarmaFundr.</p>

<p>I wanted to use colors that communicated trust, reliability and ease. I chose colors based on their emotional implications and also somewhat complimented each other.

To keep things simple, clean and readable I stayed in the Lato typeface for all aspects of the project and used them consistently throughout the application pages, only changing their size. </p>

<h3>Low-fidelity Wireframes</h3>

<p>Based on the user flow, brand identity, I created low-fidelity prototypes. I started thinking about distribution of content across all pages of the application, hierarchy of content and prioritizing information. </p>

<h3>Hi-fidelity Wireframes</h3>

<p>Taking the low-fi prototype, I created sketch wireframes. The wireframes I created in Sketch also underwent a few revisions. When I had a solid set of wireframes I created an invision prototype. Click on the link below to check it out.

<h3>Coding the design to life</h3>

<p>Now that I had the design ready, I wanted bring it to development. 

I started with HTML and CSS, used minimal JavaScript for this project. Since I had taken a course on Bootstrap and responsive design, I chose to use Bootstrap for this project.
