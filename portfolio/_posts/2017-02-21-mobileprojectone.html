			<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Narly is a concept app that captures reactions of users. Users send video and images through the app to their friends and the app captures the reaction of the receiver and sends it back to the sender. 
</p>
<h2>My Role</h2>

<p> Deliverables - Sketches and Wireframes, App Map, Use Flow diagrams, High Fidelity Prototypes

</p>

			<h2>The challenge </h2>
<p>Early on I concluded that the app needed a design that communicated effectively it’s usage. My goal with the design was to create a simple user experience targeted. </p>

<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>I spent two weeks on this project. My goal was to create an experience to encourage users to spend more time using the app. 
</p>

<h3>Design Research </h3>

<p>I spent a lot of time researching other products and services, took notes and drew inspiration from similar apps like Instagram and Snapchat. The most important thing for me during this process was to observe the UI and UX and ask myself why certain design decisions were made, and if I can implement them myself. The process helped me visualize the look and feel of the app I was trying to build. 
 </p>

<h3>Research Synthesis - User Stories and User Flows 
</h3>

<p>User stories is always an important step for me. I had the product idea, and user stories helped me figure out how a typical user would use the product. I wrote down the top 10 user stories, focusing mainly on the basics of the app. Once I had the basics on lockdown I could think about adding more capabilities later. 

Before I went into individual stories I created a site map for the application. The map was vital for me to create individual user flows for each action and to make sure I didn’t miss a step.

<h3>Sketches and Wireframes</h3>

<p>I spent a lot of time sketching and wireframing my user stories to figure out how a user would interact with the application.

<h3>UI Design</h3>

<p>I wanted to create a fun and bright interface. I picked several color palettes and tested them out before picking one. Below is the UI kit I designed for the application.

<h3>Hi-Fi Prototype </h3>


<p>I did all my wireframing on sketch. I also designed various flows on sketch then used Invision to create a clickable prototype. I was particularly focused on the major component of the app, which is sending a message to receive a reaction. You can see it in action below.
