Narly is a concept app that captures reactions of users. Users send video and images through the app to their friends and the app captures the reaction of the receiver when they watch the video/image. 

</p>

<h2>The Process </h2>
<p>I had two weeks for this project. My main goal was to create a simple and dynamic UX/UX also maintaining familiarity to encourage users to actually spend time on the app.

		<h2>Design Research </h2>
<p>I spent a lot of time researching other products and services, took notes and drew inspiration from similar apps like Instagram and Snapchat. The most important thing for me during this process was to observe the UI and UX and ask myself why certain design decisions were made, and if I can implement them myself. The process helped me visualize the look and feel of the app I was trying to build. 
</p>

<p>I completed the project with the following phases in place 
(insert image of the phases)</p>

User Stories - Sketches - Iterations/UI Design - hi-fi Prototype

<h2>Research Synthesis - User Stories and User Flows</h2>

<p>User stories is always an important step for me. I had the product idea, and user stories helped me figure out how a typical user would use the product. I wrote down the top 10 user stories, focusing mainly on the basics of the app. Once I had the basics on lockdown I could think about adding more capabilities later. 

Before I went into individual stories I created a site map for the application. The map was vital for me to create individual user flows for each action and to make sure I didn’t miss a step.
</p> 

<h2>Sketches and Wireframes</h2>
This was a critical part of the process. I spent a lot of time sketching and wireframing my user stories to figure out how a user would interact with the application.

<h2>UI Design</h2>
I wanted to create an interface that was fun. I picked several color palettes and tested them out before picking one. For the logo, I chose a font instead of a complicated pattern or a mascot. Below is the UI kit I designed for the application. 

<h2>Hi-Fi Prototype</h2>
I wireframing on balsamiq and proto-io I moved to sketch. I designed all the flows on sketch then used Invision. I was particularly focused on the major component of the app, which is sending a message to receive a reaction. You can see it in action here - (insert invision flow).

	<h2>The Solution</h2>
	<p>
<span class="lead-text"> User attention and trust</span> can be gained by making the user feel comfortable while navigating the web application. With the proper design scheme keeping in consideration the UX design fundamentals I created a nifty application that focuses on ease of use.

<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>Time is very important to a designer. If I can reduce an iteration by doing some research, then I will have more time to build other projects. With this project I went straight into Competitive Analysis, because Karma Fundr's business model isn't unique, services like KickStarter has already paved the way and are great examples to follow. My goal with KarmaFundr was to make the user experience as simple as possible.

The common goal of crowdfunding services is to make fundraising easier, which is why design plays such a pivotal role in the success of these platforms. Crowdfunding services like Kickstarter and Generosity may be a bit different but their design model seems to be heading in the same direction, simplicity while acknowledging that design doesn’t end at the landing page.

I made notes of Kickstarter and IndieGogo’s design, to understand how they arrived at the current design of their web application. What can be improved? or done differently, keeping in mind that change doesn't need to be drastic in design. </p>

<h3>User stories and flow </h3>

<p>Keeping two factors in mind, ease of navigation and effective use of time I created user stories.The goal was to minimize friction for new and existing users. It would require use of design to save time and minimize clicking, so the fundraiser and donation maker can get any task done with minimum time and effort.

The emphasis was on saving the user’s time while keeping the integrity of the experience intact. Two main users, a fundraiser and a donator, need to accomplish several different tasks efficiently . In order to achieve this, I created a <a href= "#">prioritized</a> list of user stories of the two users to help me in the development of the platform.</p>

<h3>Brand identity and Logo</h3>

<p>I started thinking about the concept of giving, where it all started and what the act of giving really means to people. That led me to the word “karma”,  a hindu word which means “deed” or “act” and more broadly names the universal principle of cause and effect, action and reaction, which Hindus believe governs all consciousness. The word is familiar to most people and people associate it with a feeling of positivity. Naming the platform just Karma wasn’t enough, I needed something that created a balance, something concrete to match the fluidity of the word karma. I played with various words until I decided on “Funder”, to make it catchy I changed it to “Fundr”.  Combining the two words I came up with KarmaFundr.</p>

<p>To communicate trust, reliability and ease I leaned into colors and a set of fonts that achieved that effectively. I chose colors based on their emotional implications and also somewhat complimented each other.

I chose Lato for this project. To keep things simple, clean and readable I stayed in the Lato typeface for all aspects of the project and used them consistently throughout the application pages, only changing their size. </p>

<h1>Bringing it together</h1>

<h3>Low-fi Wireframes</h3>

<p>Based on the user flow, brand identity, I created low-fidelity prototypes. I started thinking about distribution of content across all pages of the application, hierarchy of content and prioritizing information. The hardest part was to decide what content was more important so it could be highlighted in a certain way. </p>

<h3>Hi-fi Wireframes</h3>

<p>Taking the low-fi prototype, I created sketch wireframes. The wireframes I created in Sketch also underwent a few revisions, such is the process of design. I had a solid set of wireframes in the end which I took into development. </p>

<h1>Coding the design to life</h1>

<p>Now that I had the design ready, I wanted bring it to development.

With basic Front end web development skills that I acquired at Bloc along with supplement coding courses from FreeCodeCamp, Code Academy and Udemy I was ready to start. Coming from an artistic and creative background, coding was not intuitive to me as design. I couldn’t get creative with coding, not at the beginning. It took me longer to figure things out, which was a great learning experience for me. It made me appreciate the skill even more.

I started with HTML and CSS, used minimal JavaScript for this project. Since I had taken a course on Bootstrap and responsive design, I chose to use Bootstrap for this project. Using Bootstrap saved me a lot of time since it’s designed for responsiveness, and it gave me more time to focus on actual user experience. </p>
