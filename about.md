				<p>UX/UI designer. I am passionate about good design and engaging experiences.</p>



				<p><b>Road to UX</b></p>

				<p>There is only one thing that keeps someone from attempting to live the life they want to live, and that one thing is fear. Fear takes many forms, some learn to strike a deal with it, some completely ignore it and some give in to it.

				There has always been some form of fear within me, fear of disappointing loved ones, fear of disappointing myself. 

				I wanted to pursue Graphic Design in college, giddy with excitement I took as many art classes I could but when it came time to choose a major I chose Business. For me choosing business as my major was choosing security over fear. I enjoyed learning about financial statements, ROI and KPI. After college I started working at an amazing company that creates app-powered lifestyle accessories and content creation tools, where I learned tools and trades of marketing, sales and product development. But I felt like my creativity could flourish if I was doing something I really love. If I didn’t follow a path I wanted to follow now, then when?

			<p>I decided to face my fears head on. The little artist/designer in me wanted to come out.</p>



			<p>First step was to find out what profession in design will I fit in. Going back to a 4 year college was not an option, so I started taking online coding and design courses. I learned more about a designer's role in today’s fast paced world of technology, and realized that this is where I would fit. This was it. </p>



			<p>I enrolled in <a href="https://www.bloc.io/">Bloc's</a> Design and Front-end Web Development Apprenticeship program where I was mentored by <a href="#"> Mike Dekkar</a>, <a href="#">Kevin Mcgilliary</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/designhawg">Chris Courtney</a>. As I went through the design fundamentals part of the course, I was introduced again to familiar concepts like color theory and problem solving. I quickly grasped those familiar concepts. I also started to see how I was developing as a designer as the course came to an end. As a designer, I was more focused in the process rather than the end goal. While the end goal is very important,  without the process, the finished product may look substantial but fail to solve a problem and ultimately be more decorative than deliberate. The process of design reminded me of my own life, which is a process in itself. </p>

			<p>Letting go of my fears is turning out to be a rewarding experience for me. I want to communicate this philosophy with my design and work with like minded people with whom I can continue to create with a fearless and process first mindset.
