		<h1>Road to Design</h1>
					<h2>I'm Pravi and this is the story of how I finally overcame my fears and chose the path of UX/UI design</h2>

				<p>There is only one thing that keeps someone from attempting to live the life they want to live, and that one thing is fear. Fear takes many forms, some learn to strike a deal with it, some completely ignore it and some give in to it.

				There has always been some form of fear within me, fear of disappointing loved ones, fear of disappointing myself.For the most part, my fears kept me from living my passion.

				I wanted to pursue Graphic Design in college, giddy with excitement I took as many art classes I could; however, when it came time to choose a major I chose Business. For me, choosing business as my major was choosing security over fear.I enjoyed learning about financial statements, ROI and KPI. After college I started working at an amazing gaming and accessories company that creates app-powered lifestyle accessories and content creation tools.There I learned tools and trades of marketing, sales and product development. Nevertheless, I felt like my appreciation for work would only really flourish if I was doing something more creative. If I didn’t make a decision to change, then when would I?

			<p>I decided to face my fears head on.The little artist/designer in me wanted to come out.It wasn't an "aha" moment, where I woke up one day and decided to change everything, it was an arduous process, but I truly believed in it this time. </p>

			<p>First step was to find out what profession in design would fit me best.Going back to a 4 year college was not an option, so I started taking online coding and design courses.I learned more about a designer's role in today’s fast paced world of technology, and realized that this was where I would flourish. This was it. </p>

			<p>I enrolled in <a href="https://www.bloc.io/">Bloc's</a> Design and Front-end Web Development Apprenticeship program where I was mentored by <a href="#"> Mike Dekkar</a>, <a href="#">Kevin Mcgilliary</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/designhawg">Chris Courtney</a>.As I went through the design fundamentals part of the course, I was introduced again to familiar concepts like color theory and problem solving. I quickly grasped those familiar concepts. I also started to see how I was developing as a designer.I was more focused in the process rather than the end goal.While the end goal is very important,  without the process, the finished product may look substantial but fail to solve the problem and ultimately be more decorative than deliberate.The process of design reminded me of my own life, which is a process in itself.</p>

			<p>Letting go of my fears is turning out to be a rewarding experience and this road to design has been instrumental in teaching me not to make decisions based on fear. I want to communicate this philosophy with my design work and to surround myself with like minded people in my field. I want to work in an environment where I can continue to create visions with a fearless and process first mindset.
