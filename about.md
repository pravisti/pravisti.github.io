		<p>I am a recent grad of bloc.ioâ€™s UX/UI design and Front-end web development program. The program was an apprenticeship. I had a great experience working with mentors<a href="http://kevinmcgillivray.net/about/"> Kevin McGilliary</a> (Front-end) and <a href= "http://mikedekker.com/"> Mike Dekkar</a> (UX/UI Design). Together we worked on developing a strong foundation which was essential in building real world projects and solutions. My portfolio consists of projects from my apprenticeship.</p>
		


       <p> I am equally passionate about design and front end dev. My fascination with art and design began early on, and I have formal training in both. On the other hand I discovered coding later on, started tinkering with online coding resources like udemy and freecodecamp. Then I bought a book on HTML/CSS by John Duckket which inspired me to pursue a career in design and development.</p>

		<p>Besides web development I am also really into making things on illustrator, and sketching. I am better with images than writing words so I tend to sketch most of my ideas on a piece of paper with a pen (an old school tool people use to write with). You can find some of my sketches on my sketchbook. I designed and created all the illustrations in this website.</p>
