<p>

	I completed an apprenticeship in UX/UI design at Bloc in 2015 and developed a passion for pastels and web development, in the same order. You can check out my projects from my time there <a href = "/portfolio.html">here</a>.  
</p>

				<p>
I like working on projects that intrigue and cater to my artistic side. Currently I am looking for projects/work where I can polish my creative abilities as well as hone my coding skills.
