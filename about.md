		I am a recent grad of bloc.ioâ€™s UX/UI design and Front-end web development program. The program is an apprenticeship. I had a great experience working with mentors Kevin McGilliary(Front-end) and Mike Dekkar (UX/UI Design). Together we worked on developing a strong education foundation which was essential in building real world projects and solutions. My portfolio consists of those real world projects and solutions from my apprenticeship.
		


		I am equally passionate about design and front end dev and would not feel content only doing one of them. That's the reason why I chose to be a UI Developer.

		Besides UI Development I am also really into making things on illustrator, I am better with images than writing words therefore I tend to sketch most of my ideas on a piece of paper with a pen (an old school tool people use to write with) . I made all the illustrations (icons, images, banners) in the portfolio which I designed as well. You can check out my digital illustrations here and old school hand illustrations here.
